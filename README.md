# Chiang Mai Showtimes

I find cinema websites in Chiang Mai cumbersome to navigate.

So I decided to build an app that scraped showtime data from those cinema sites, then supplemented that data with movie details from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and render it in a simple and easy to use interface.

Current demo [here](http://chiangmaimovies.com).

## Todo
- add other cinemas in Chiang Mai
- make UI even more awesome
- try and incorporate [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) data. Waiting on approval to access [their API](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/).
